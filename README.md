## Problem Statement
Analyzing Key Metrics to Drive E-Commerce Growth and Optimize Performance Specifically, the project seeks to answer:
- Sales Trends Analysis
  
- Customer Retention rate 
- Geographical Performance
- Delivery and Sales Relationship
- Customer Segmentation


## Methodology:
The analysis was conducted using Excel.

- Data Cleaning and Preparation with Power Query

- Data Visualisation - created interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present the findings and insights. These dashboards made it easier to communicate the results to stakeholders and highlight key factors contributing to Sales.

## Key nsights and findings:
- Retention Rate: 39.75%, which seems low. This suggests a high customer churn rate, indicating the need for strategies to improve customer loyalty.

- Yearly Sales: Sales have remained relatively stable between 2021 and 2022, with a slight decline ($11,630,021.60 in 2021 vs. $11,526,831.92 in 2022). Efforts may be needed to reverse this downward trend.

- Monthly Trends: Sales fluctuate throughout the year, with notable peaks and drops. Understanding seasonality could optimize marketing efforts during low months.

- Top-Performing Category: Office Supplies generated the highest sales ($15,168,955.66), significantly outperforming Furniture ($5,454,982.24) and Technology ($4,597,490.94).

- East and West contribute significantly to sales compared to the Central and South regions. Expanding in Central and South regions could increase overall revenue.

- Late Deliveries: Generate the highest revenue, which could indicate either a delay in popular products or customers tolerating delays for high-demand items. However, it may affect customer satisfaction.

- Advance Shipping and On-Time Delivery: Perform well but contribute less revenue. Exploring how to improve delivery performance could enhance retention.

- Top Customer Segment: The Corporate segment dominates sales in all product categories. Efforts to grow the Home segments could diversify the customer base.

## Recommendations:
- Improve customer retention strategies, like loyalty programs or personalized offers, to increase the retention rate.

- Investigate why Technology sales are lagging and implement targeted campaigns to boost this category.

- Focus marketing campaigns in the Central and South regions to balance geographical performance.

- Analyze late delivery reasons to optimize logistics while ensuring customer satisfaction.

- Expand offerings or incentives for Consumer and Home Office segments to reduce dependency on Corporate customers.
- Create a loyalty program aimed at Home customers, offering points or rewards for repeat purchases. Incentivize their continued engagement with free delivery or early access to sales.
- Offer exclusive discounts or bundle deals specifically for Home customers. For example, "Buy a desk and get a chair at 20% off" could appeal to individual homeowners.

   By implementing these strategies, the organization can optimize sales performance, enhance customer retention, improve delivery efficiency, and unlock growth opportunities in underperforming regions and customer segments, ensuring sustainable business growth.
